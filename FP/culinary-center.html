        <p>The project is a culinary center located on Sledding Hill in Pittsburgh. 
          The building has both public and private areas. 
          The public area opens to a lobby, such leads to rooms such as a caf√© and a dining room. 
          Further back, in the more private area, rooms like classrooms, lecture theaters, teaching kitchens, and changing rooms can be found.

        <p>We have two design strategies: 
          1. blurring the boundary between interior and exterior to bring surrounding natural features in, and 2
          . making the building more inviting to the public. Our building organization has two focal points with a circulation spine tying them together. 
          The two focal points are the public area and the outdoor courtyard, which implements the two strategies: community and nature. 
          The two strategies come from the philosophy of our chef, Jeong Kwan. 
          She believes that food has the power to connect the community and emphasizes the importance of taking the ingredients from nature.

        <p>The most public-facing part of the site is located near the intersection of the main street and the trail.
          This area includes the lobby and the cafe. 
          The walls of the cafe and lobby are made of glass so that they are visible and accessible to the public. 
          The outdoor seating and the farmer's market serve as an extension of the lobby, connecting the main road and serving to further bring in the community.
